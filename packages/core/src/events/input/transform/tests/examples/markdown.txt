## Understanding Markdown Headings
In this section, we'll explore how to use headings in Markdown to structure a document effectively.

### Using Lists and Bullet Points
Lists are a great way to organize information succinctly. Here's an example:
- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

#### Adding Links and References
To reference external sources, you can include links like this:
