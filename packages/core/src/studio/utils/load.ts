/**
 * Asynchronously loads a graph from a specified file. This function is designed to read
 * a graph's serialized data from a file, deserialize it, and instantiate a `BaseGraph` object.
 * 
 * @param file A string that represents the name or identifier of the file containing the graph data.
 * @param path The path where the file is located.
 * @param values Optional. An object containing key-value pairs that may be required for initializing
 *               nodes within the graph based on the serialized data.
 * @param registry Optional. An object containing `NodeRegistration` for node types and
 *                 `GuardrailRegistration` for guardrails that may be needed during deserialization.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an instance of `BaseGraph`.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const graph = await loadGraphFromFile('myApp.encre', '/graphs');
