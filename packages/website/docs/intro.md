<h3  class="font-semi-bold">Encre is an <strong  class="font-bold">open-source framework</strong> designed to revolutionize the creation and deployment of AI-driven applications, enabling users of <strong  class="font-bold">all skill levels</strong> to build sophisticated <strong  class="font-bold">AI agents and applications</strong> effortlessly. Encre empowers users to design, construct, and iterate on applications quickly and efficiently. Learn more about Encre and how it works.</h3>

[**`Encre Studio`**](./api/core/modules.md) Encre offers a state-of-the-art **low-code/no-code** development environment, designed for users who wise to harness the power of AI without delving deep into coding. This environment features a **user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface** that simplifies the process of building and deploying AI-driven applications. Ideal for **content creators**, **project managers**, and **non-technical users**, it enables the _quick visualization_ and _construction of complex AI functionalities_, from _chatbots_ to _automated workflows_. With Encre Studio, creating prowerful AI applications is intuitive and accessible, ensuring that anyone can contribute to innovation and efficiency within their organization.

[**`Encre Core`**](./api/core/modules.md) For **developers** and **software engineers** seeking _finer control_ and _customization_, Encre provides a robust code-based development environment. This feature supports the creation of _sophisticated, stateful AI application_ using advanced programming capabilities. Encre Core is designed in a **modular fashion** to enable deep customization of Large Language Models (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, etcs.) and tools (e.g. ChromaDB, PDFLoader, etcs.), enabling developers to push the boundaries of what AI applications can achieve in various operational contexts.

Encre seamlessly integrates the advanced functionalities in the **Encre Core** into the **Encre Studio** through a sophisticated **node-graph system**. Each complex, code-based feature is encapsulated as an executatble node, allowing users to easily incorporate these powerful capabilities into their applications. With this hybrid approach, Encre bridges the gap between accessibility and technological sophistication, making advanced AI solutions available to a broader range of users and use cases.
